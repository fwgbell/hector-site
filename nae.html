        <h1>Not an Excuse (2018)</h1>
        <p>This film is a portrait about a Percussionist at music school who suffers with ADHD. He tells us how it can affect him
        on a day to day basis but also how it can be a blessing in disguise. We see how his passion for music works as a coping
        mechanism for him. The aim is to reflect the subject’s character and condition in the filmmaking</p>
